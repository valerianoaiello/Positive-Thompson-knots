# Positive Thompson Knots

## The Thompson group $F$ and the Brown-Thompson group $F_3$
The Thompson group $F$ and the Brown-Thompson group $F_3$ admit infinite presentations, namely 
$\langle y_0, y_1, ...| y_n y_l = y_l y_{n+1}$ for all $l < n\rangle$ and
$\langle x_0, x_1, ...| x_n x_l = x_l x_{n+2}$ for all $l < n\rangle$, respectively.

Both contain interesting monoids. The positive monoid $F_+$ of $F$ is the one generated by $y_0$, $y_1$, ...
Similarly, the positive monoid $F_{3,+}$ of $F_3$ is  generated by by $x_0$, $x_1$, ...
The elements of these monoids are called positive.

Every element positive element of $F_3$ can be written as $x_0^{a_0}\cdots x_n^{a_n}$ for some $n$, $a_0$, ..., $a_{n-1}$ in $\mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ and 
and $a_n\in \mathbb{N}$. We call $n$ the width and $\max_{i}a_i$ the height of the element.

## Jones construction of knots
In 2014 Vaughan Jones defined a method to construct link from elements of the Thompson group $F$, which was later extended to the Brown-Thompson group $F_3$. Both $F$ and $F_3$ are just as a good as the braid groups at producing links. More precisely, for every link $L$ there exists an element $g$ such that its closure $\mathcal{L}(g)$ is equivalent to $L$.

## Thompson Permutations
It is possible to associate permutations to braids in a natural way, where the number of orbits (or cycles in the cycle decomposition) of the permutation is equal to the number of connected components of the link.
We define a method to associate a permutation $\mathcal{P}(g)$ to each element $g$ of the Brown-Thompson group in such a way that its number of orbits coincides with the number of connected components of $\mathcal{L}(g)$. We call $\mathcal{P}(g)$ the Thompson permutation associated with $g$.

In this project we present a function, called "whole_permutation" that produces $\mathcal{P}(g)$ for positives element. It receives a numpy vector $v=(a_0,a_1, ..., a_n)$ as an input and returns a permutations as a list.
