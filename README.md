# Positive Thompson Knots

## The Thompson group $F$ and the Brown-Thompson group $F_3$
The Thompson group $F$ and the Brown-Thompson group $F_3$ admit infinite presentations, namely 
$\langle y_0, y_1, ...| y_n y_l = y_l y_{n+1}$ for all $l < n\rangle$ and
$\langle x_0, x_1, ...| x_n x_l = x_l x_{n+2}$ for all $l < n\rangle$, respectively.

Both contain interesting monoids. The positive monoid $F_+$ of $F$ is the one generated by $y_0$, $y_1$, ...
Similarly, the positive monoid $F_{3,+}$ of $F_3$ is  generated by by $x_0$, $x_1$, ...
The elements of these monoids are called positive.

Every element positive element of $F_3$ can be written as $x_0^{a_0}\cdots x_n^{a_n}$ for some $n$, $a_0$, ..., $a_{n-1}$ in $\mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ and 
and $a_n\in \mathbb{N}$. We call $n$ the width and $\max_{i}a_i$ the height of the element.

## Jones construction of knots
In 2014 Vaughan Jones defined a method to construct link from elements of the Thompson group $F$, which was later extended to the Brown-Thompson group $F_3$, [Jo14, Jo18]. Both $F$ and $F_3$ are just as a good as the braid groups at producing links. More precisely, for every link $L$ there exists an element $g$ such that its closure $\mathcal{L}(g)$ is equivalent to $L$.

## Thompson Permutations
It is possible to associate permutations to braids in a natural way, where the number of orbits (or cycles in the cycle decomposition) of the permutation is equal to the number of connected components of the link.
We define a method to associate a permutation $\mathcal{P}(g)$ to each element $g$ of the Brown-Thompson group in such a way that its number of orbits coincides with the number of connected components of $\mathcal{L}(g)$. We call $\mathcal{P}(g)$ the Thompson permutation associated with $g$.

In this project we present a function, called "whole_permutation" that produces $\mathcal{P}(g)$ for positives element. It receives a numpy vector $v=(a_0,a_1, ..., a_n)$ as an input and returns a permutations as a list (the elements of the list are the distict cycles of the permutation).

We explored the permutations of elements with selected values of width and height. The results are stored in csv files.
